# CSJiraAssess
Repository for uploading code for Jira coding Assessment for Crowdstrike Application

Had lots of fun figuring this out! The code was written in groovy and tested in scriptrunner console and the Jira version was 8.20.11 and ScriptRunner version was 8.0.0

I have provided 2 options for Assessment 2 (Option 2A shows the total number of projects where a custom field is used, Option 2B shows a breakdown per project of the field usage as well as a total for all projects for field usage)
